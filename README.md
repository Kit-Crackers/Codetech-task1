**Objective**

The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the data by analyzing its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and identifying any outliers. The analysis will be visualized using various graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

**Key Activities**
1.	Data Loading: Loaded the Titanic dataset from a CSV file using pandas.

2.	Data Cleaning:
	
 o	Handled missing data by filling missing values in columns like Age and Embarked.
	
 o	Analyzed the data for missing values and visualized the filled data.

3.	Data Exploration:
	
 o	Explored the dataset's key characteristics, such as passenger survival rate, age distribution, and fare distribution.
	
 o	Visualized the survival rate by gender and passenger class using bar plots.

 o	Analyzed the distribution of fare and age using histograms and boxplots.

4.	Data Visualization:
	
 o	Used seaborn and matplotlib to create various visualizations including:
		
  	Histograms: To show the distribution of age and fare.
  
  	Count Plots: To show survival by gender and passenger class.
		
  	Heatmap: To show correlations between numerical features.
		
  	Boxplot: To visualize fare distribution across different passenger classes.

5.	Insights and Findings:
	
 o	Identified patterns, such as the higher survival rate among females and 1st class passengers.
	
 o	Analyzed the age distribution and its correlation with survival rate.


**Technologies Used**

•	Python: Programming language used for the analysis and data manipulation.

•	Pandas: For loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset.

•	NumPy: For handling numerical operations.

•	Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations such as histograms and boxplots.

•	Seaborn: For creating advanced visualizations like heatmaps and count plots.

**Dataset Information**

•	The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic, including features such as:

o	PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.

o	Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).		

o	Name: Name of the passenger.

o	Sex: Gender of the passenger.

o	Age: Age of the passenger.

o	SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.

o	Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.

o	Fare: Ticket price.

o	Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

o	Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

**Key Insights**

•	Gender and Survival Rate: Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.

•	Passenger Class: Passengers in 1st class had a significantly higher chance of survival than those in 2nd and 3rd class.

•	Age: Younger passengers (children) had a higher survival rate.

•	Fare: 1st class passengers paid significantly higher fares than those in 2nd and 3rd class, and they also had a higher survival rate.
